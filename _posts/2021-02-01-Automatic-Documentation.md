I recently added a new tutorial, [located here]({% link _tutorials/Automatic_Documentation.md %}). It covers how to set
up a workflow to automate the building and publishing of code API documentation using Doxygen and GitHub Pages. Once
configured, it is a great way to ensure documentation is always up to date and accessible to anyone using your code. I
use it extensively for any of [my projects]({% link _pages/projects.md %}) The steps are also fairly simple to follow.
Be sure to check it out!
