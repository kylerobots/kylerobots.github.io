## About Me ##
I am a passionate, self-driven robotics researcher. Since growing up with Star Wars, I have always been fascinated with
robotics. I've turned that interest into a fulfilling career that has allowed me to hone my researching abilities while
also gaining experience in overseeing a broader research portfolio. Recently, I have expanded this knowledge even
further this knowledge by embarking on a part-time PhD program in addition to my full-time career.
