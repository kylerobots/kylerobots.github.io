## About Me ##
I am a passionate, self-driven robotics researcher. Since growing up with Star Wars, I have always been fascinated with
robotics and I've turned that interest into a fulfilling career that has allowed me to hone my researching abilities
while overseeing a broader research portfolio. Recently, I have expanded this knowledge even further by embarking on a
part-time PhD program in addition to my full-time career. I've started this site to share in my progress, practice my
writing, document my projects, and pass on useful information I've discovered along the way.
