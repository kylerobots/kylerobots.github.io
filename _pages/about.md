## About Me ##
I am a passionate, self-driven robotics researcher. Since growing up with Star Wars, I have always been fascinated with
robotics and I've turned that interest into a fulfilling career that has allowed me to hone my researching abilities
while overseeing a broader research portfolio. Recently, I have expanded this knowledge even further by embarking on a
part-time PhD program in addition to my full-time career. I've started this site to share in my progress, practice my
writing, document my projects, and pass on useful information I've discovered along the way.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

Robotics and Intelligent Systems Engineering Lab, Department of the Navy
- Lead a lab of 9 full time researchers, 2 part time researchers, and numerous rotations and interns with an annual operating budget of approximately $1.3M
- Developed roadmap and strategic plan to guide lab’s project proposals, hiring plan, and training requests
- Created 101 tutorial with case study and setup guides to teach new members essential tools
- Wrote code review SOP to improve efficiency merging in new software features
-	Implemented SOPs for rotation recruitment and onboarding to reduce time and effort securing quality rotations
- Worked with IT to shift lab from unconnected to connected computers without disrupting workflow, decreasing support costs and increasing team collaboration
- Guided 5 mentees in identifying strategic rotations that expanded their knowledge and brought enhanced capabilities back to the lab
- Regularly provide briefs ranging from admirals to high school students, tailoring each brief to the audience
