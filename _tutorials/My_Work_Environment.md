title: My Work Environment
---
I have a somewhat unusual development environment. Almost all of my development
is on C++, with a little bit on Python for class. Additionally, I only occasionally
develop GUIs. Most of the time, I am developing applications for the command line.
As such, I tend not to use an IDE for most development. When most of my work consists
of some C++ files and a CMakeLists to pull it all together, an IDE seems like
overkill.

However, I make extensive use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
It is a phenominal editor that is practically an IDE at this point. There is also an
extensive marketplace for Microsoft and 3rd party developed plugins offering a wide
arrange of functionality. However, it doesn't come with any build tools. So I need
to configure all them manually.

Additionally, I also use VS Code at work on different devices there.
I have a Windows computer and an Ubuntu computer. I also have personal
computers at home I use for personal projects. I also sometimes use
Qt and QtCreator for GUI development.

The end result is
a lot of configuring needed to achieve uniformity across each
computer. To expediate this, I've started leveraging package
managers and syncronized settings
